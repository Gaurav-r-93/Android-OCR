# Android-OCR
This project is an Android OCR (Optical Character Recognition) app that allows users to extract text from images captured with their mobile devices. The app utilizes advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize and convert the text in the image into editable and searchable content.

Users can capture an image using their device's camera or select an existing image from their gallery. The app will then process the image, extract the text, and display it to the user. The extracted text can be edited, copied, or shared with other applications on the device.
